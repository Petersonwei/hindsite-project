 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css.

 * With Propshaft, assets are served efficiently without preprocessing steps.
 * We're using a modular approach with multiple stylesheets for better organization.
 *
 * Order matters - later styles will override earlier ones:
 * 1. Base styles (CSS reset, variables, foundational elements)
 * 2. Components (reusable UI components)
 * 3. Layout (page structure)
 * 4. Custom styles (page-specific styles)
